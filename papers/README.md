# EE 584 - Papers (Please)

EE 584 Wireless Systems Security consisted of 3 Papers, a Course Final Project Paper with Presentation, and Participation in Case Studies. </br>
</br>
Each of the Papers went beyond the threshold, each scored above a 100%, and each were the highest grades in that semester.

* Paper 1 (Wireless Technical Paper): 12.33/10
* Paper 2 (Security Technical Paper): 13.67/10
* Paper 3 (Wireless Security Paper): 11.33/10
* Course Final Presentation: 11.67/10
* Course Final Report: 117/100

Below are descriptions on what each paper was about:

## Paper 1 - Wireless Technical Paper

* Access the IEEE library of publications
* On the IEEE IExplore site, click on the Table of Contents Journal and Magazines, on the left side
* The complete contents of the IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications is available by clicking on the W from the list of letters across the top of the page and following the link to "Wireless Communications, IEEE Transactions on"
* Pick a Wireless Communications Transactions paper that interests you from any of those available from the last 5 years
* Write a 3-5 page report on the paper. Report should include:
  * Citation of the paper you are using
  * Summary of fundamental ideas presented in the paper
  * Issues paper addresses and how they have been addressed in the past
  * Discussion of 1 or 2 core ideas of paper
  * Identification of any security-related issues brought up in the paper (there may not be any)
  * Potential applications of technology presented
  * Future opportunities created by the technology

Note: The IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications IS NOT the same as the IEEE Wireless Communications maganize. Be sure to use the *Transactions* for this assignment.

## Paper 2 - Security Technical Paper

* Follow the instructions from Week 3, Paper 1 assignment, to access the IEEE Conference Proceedings datbase
* Pick an article from the Proceeding of IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (from the last 5 years) that interests you
* Write a 3-5 page report on the paper. Report should include
  * Citation of the paper you are using
  * Summary of fundamental ideas presented in the paper
  * Issues paper addresses and how they have been addressed in the past
  * Discussion of 1 or 2 core ideas of paper
  * Identification of any ***wireless-related issues*** brought up in the paper (there may not be any)
  * Potential applications of technology presented
  * Future opportunities created by the technology

This one is on the general topic of security. The overall process is the same, just the potential references are different. </br>
This assignment is to be derived from the IEEE Security and Privacy Proceedings, which is based on the annual conference of an IEEE society. This is NOT the IEEE Security and Privacy maganize, which is published monthly.

## Paper 3 - Wireless Security Paper

* Research "wireless security" (or related subjects - e.g., privacy, etc., just as long as the topic includes aspects related to wireless systems and security issues as we have discussed in the course)
* Use whatever resources are available to you: the Internet, your local technical library, technical journals, etc.
* Pick a reference that interests you and search for related material or links
* Write a 3-5 page report on the material you have found. Report should include:
  * Citation of source
  * Summary of fundamental ideas presented
  * Issues addressed and how they may have been addressed in the past
  * Discussion of 1 or 2 core ideas presented
  * Potential applications of technology presented (or) potential issues created
  * Future directions suggseted or ones that you might infer from the topic

This one is on the general topic of wireless security. The overall process is the same, just the potential references are different. For this paper, any topic in wireless security is acceptable and any source you want to use is acceptable. Just make sure you cite the source of your material.

## Course Project

* Pick a topic you are interested in or project you may be working on. Topic should involve either
  * A wireless system that has notable security issues
  * Security issues that are exacerbated in wireless systems
* Research the topic - current technical journal and conference paper references are desirable, but all sources are welcome
* Prepare a 5-8 paper on the topic - due during the next to last week of class
* Prepare a short presentation on the topic - due during the next to last week of class
* Material covered in paper should address:
  * Background on topic: What is the general issue being addressed?
  * A brief assessment of the security aspects (use the structure of security assessments we have done in class)
  * In the context of the security services presented, what are the major security issues?
  * How dramatic are the security concerns (e.g., likelihood of attack)
  * Does it appear that there are efficient ways to improve security (e.g., cost-benefit tradeoffs)
  * What conclusions can you draw about the future directions for this topic (e.g., will it take major loss of assets to cause action to be taken? Is future technology likely to make the issue better or worse? How widespread is understanding of underlying concern? What might change this? Is this a chronic or an acute issue?)
  * References
* The presentation should briefly cover the key points in the paper and provide detail on one or two

So far, there have been two papers assigned in class. There will be third that is due before class project. Development of papers’ topic is: wireless technology, security technology, wireless security technology. Sources for first two papers has been restricted to particular journals and conference proceedings. Third paper will be less restricted. In contrast, project is completely open to any source interested in. Requirement is that project deal with security in wireless system </br>
</br>
Unlike three papers, which are intended to be reviews of subject material, project is intended to apply security assessment methodology have been discussing in course. At this point, have completed three assessments with four more to do, each treating different type of wireless system. Project can either go into additional depth on case study have addressed, or can address different type of system, as long as it is wireless and has security issues associated with it </br>
</br>
Project is in two parts. 5-8 written report, which I will not distribute to class, and “presentation” which will be shared with everyone. When I ran course last semester as live class, presentations were standard viewgraph presentation that course slides would be in live course. For this on-line session of course, I would like you to prepare slides, but slides should be accompanied by speaker notes, as I have annotated my slides. Audience should be able to look at slides and read notes to get same information would have presented if were speaking in front of them. Don’t have to, but if would like to use “Record Narration” feature of PowerPoint (in PowerPoint2000, this is menu item under Slide Show), may do so </br>
</br>
I need each set of slides, either in PowerPoint (NOT PowerPoint XP format - I can’t open it), or Adobe PDF, or some other format clear with me in advance, during Week 12 so I can put them up on WebCT during Week 13 </br>
</br>
Note: It goes without saying that presentation and written project are ***ON SAME SUBJECT***. I have had students change their mind after they submitted presentation, deciding that they couldn’t find enough material to do report. This suggests that they didn’t start report until very last minute, despite fact that this is supposed to be term project. I will not accept report that covers different subject than presentation
